       <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>During the 2011 Tokoku earthquake that hit the northeast coast of Japan, widespread damage occurred to many buildings and coastal structures due to different destructive phenomena. Liquefaction was the main impact of the earthquake itself, as moving plates loosened the soil and caused buildings to weaken and collapse. Whilst it was not well mitigated, this may be because liquefaction doesn’t occur with lower magnitude earthquakes and so, it generally does not cause issues. Hydrodynamic forces had a large impact in the destruction of coastal regions as the water pressure from the tsunami waves hit and demolished many buildings. Coastal countermeasures such as breakwaters and sea walls are typically successful at mitigating storm surges, however, they were not designed to withstand overpowering tsunami waves. Overall, it may seem unnecessary to invest in extreme countermeasures for an event that is a rarity, such as a magnitude 9 earthquake, which is a once in a generation occurrence.</p>

    <div id="Introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>On the 11th of March 2011, Japan experienced a magnitude 9 earthquake that hit its northeast coast (Uchida, 2011). Together with the tsunami that followed, it caused ‘widespread destruction to buildings, breakwaters, tide embankments’ (Uhsumi, 2019) and much of the damage occurred ‘along the Pacific coastline in the Tokoku region’ (Takezawa, 2016). The impacts of the earthquake can be separated from those of the tsunami as they each triggered different destructive phenomena. Certain countermeasures were put in place to mitigate impacts such as seawalls and offshore breakwaters (Oetjen, 2022), however, their effectiveness varied. </p>

    <div id="Impacts of the earthquake">
      <h2>Impacts of the earthquake</h2>
      <p>The main consequence of the seismic activityee was liquefaction, causing buildings to become unstable due to ground deformation (Yu, 2013). During earthquakes, liquefaction occurs when a state change takes place as the ‘water pressure of saturated sand increases rapidly’ (Yu, 2013) which triggers the foundations of structures to weaken and collapse. Pile supported buildings are particularly affected by soil liquefaction as they are formed from long cylinders ‘made of materials such as concrete or steel, which are used to support the structure’ (Mokarram-Aydenlou, 2020) from underground. </p>
