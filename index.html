       <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>During the 2011 Tokoku earthquake that hit the northeast coast of Japan, widespread damage occurred to many buildings and coastal structures due to different destructive phenomena. Liquefaction was the main impact of the earthquake itself, as moving plates loosened the soil and caused buildings to weaken and collapse. Whilst it was not well mitigated, this may be because liquefaction doesn’t occur with lower magnitude earthquakes and so, it generally does not cause issues. Hydrodynamic forces had a large impact in the destruction of coastal regions as the water pressure from the tsunami waves hit and demolished many buildings. Coastal countermeasures such as breakwaters and sea walls are typically successful at mitigating storm surges, however, they were not designed to withstand overpowering tsunami waves. Overall, it may seem unnecessary to invest in extreme countermeasures for an event that is a rarity, such as a magnitude 9 earthquake, which is a once in a generation occurrence.</p>

    <div id="Introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>On the 11th of March 2011, Japan experienced a magnitude 9 earthquake that hit its northeast coast (Uchida, 2011). Together with the tsunami that followed, it caused ‘widespread destruction to buildings, breakwaters, tide embankments’ (Uhsumi, 2019) and much of the damage occurred ‘along the Pacific coastline in the Tokoku region’ (Takezawa, 2016). The impacts of the earthquake can be separated from those of the tsunami as they each triggered different destructive phenomena. Certain countermeasures were put in place to mitigate impacts such as seawalls and offshore breakwaters (Oetjen, 2022), however, their effectiveness varied. </p>

    <div id="Impacts of the earthquake">
      <h2>Impacts of the earthquake</h2>
      <p>The main consequence of the seismic activityee was liquefaction, causing buildings to become unstable due to ground deformation (Yu, 2013). During earthquakes, liquefaction occurs when a state change takes place as the ‘water pressure of saturated sand increases rapidly’ (Yu, 2013) which triggers the foundations of structures to weaken and collapse. Pile supported buildings are particularly affected by soil liquefaction as they are formed from long cylinders ‘made of materials such as concrete or steel, which are used to support the structure’ (Mokarram-Aydenlou, 2020) from underground. </p>

      <p>Figure 1 shows the process of liquefaction weakening the columns as the sand becomes liquefied and loses rigidity, allowing the columns to move (Rostami, R. et al, 2018). One proposed method of mitigating the impact of liquefaction is to inject cement into the soil. Bhattacharya concluded this would reduce the columns bending and sufficiently prevent liquefaction triggering (Rostami, R. et al, 2018).</p>
      <p>Heavy liquefaction damage occurred in the Tokyo Bay waterfront areas. Figure 2 shows the gaps created between pile supported structures and the surrounding ground (Tokimatsu et al, 2012).</p>

      <p>In general, liquefaction was poorly mitigated during the earthquake, which may be due to it only occurring when the magnitude of an earthquake is around 5 or above (Green, R et al, 2019). In Japan, ‘roughly 5000 minor quakes occur every year’ (Young, no date), of which just over 160 are measured at a magnitude of 5 (Young, no date). As liquefaction does not occur during most earthquakes, it may have been viewed unnecessary to tackle a problem that doesn’t happen often, especially as it’s estimated that only one to three magnitude 9 earthquakes occur every century (McCaffrey, 2008).</p>

    <div id="Impacts of the tsunami">
      <h2>Impacts of the tsunami</h2>
      <p>Tsunami damage can be attributed to hydrodynamic forces, which are caused by water pressure from a tsunami, exerting force on a building (American Society of Civil Engineers, 2013). Considering that coastal areas were most affected, implementing breakwaters would have been an effective method to protect coasts as they mitigate wave impact (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020).  However, according to Esteban et al, they aren’t always reliable. In deep water, breakwaters can be washed away when hit by a tsunami and can only withstand impacts in shallow waters (Oetjen et al, 2022). This was exhibited at Hachimohe Port which was protected by a 7000-metre breakwater. An investigation took place which revealed that 1500 metres of the breakwater was destroyed, and the wave had completely overtopped it (Chock, 2013). Evidently, breakwaters were ineffective at mitigating the tsunami impact and regardless of how large they are constructed, if the wave height surmounts the height of the breakwater, they become almost entirely obsolete. It also promotes a hazard, for if the wave causes a collapse of the breakwater, displacements could occur (Jones, 2022) leading to further structural damage if the concrete boulders flow inland.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Another method of mitigating the effects of hydrodynamic forces is through the use of seawalls, which are massive structures ‘designed primarily to resist wave action’ (US Army Corps of Engineers, 1995). Unlike breakwaters, which are built out into the sea, seawalls run along the shore and effectively resist storm surges. They can reduce ‘coastal damages if they are designed as non-overtopping structure, otherwise, they are likely to be destroyed by an extreme-wave event’ (Oetjen et al, 2020). In general, curved sea walls are incorporated into the design (Schoonees, 2014) as they imitate ‘the wave shape as it moves towards the land and repels it back to the sea’ (Trapbag, 2021). This reduces the risk of overtopping.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, ‘Japanese seawalls were not designed considering wave overtopping as potential design criteria’ (Oetjen et al, 2020) which is likely to be the reason why many seawalls were destroyed during the tsunami. This was evident in the city of Miyako where the seawall was heavily overtopped by a large wave as shown in figure 5 and ‘black water, including floating vehicles and boats…cascaded over the wall like flow over a spillway’ (Chock, 2013).</p>

    <div id="Conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Countermeasures built to mitigate the impacts of earthquakes and tsunamis are often designed to accommodate the magnitude of disaster commonly experienced in that area. As   just over 160 earthquakes in Japan are measured at a magnitude of 5 (Young, no date), the Tohoku earthquake can be viewed as an outlier, being the strongest earthquake recorded in Japan’s history (National Geographic Society, 2023). The success of mitigation strategies cannot be analysed based on their performance during this earthquake and tsunami. Breakwaters are not built to withstand such tall and powerful waves and liquefaction only poses a threat with higher magnitude earthquakes. </p>
      <p>Ultimately, when it is estimated that only one to three magnitude 9 earthquakes occur every century (McCaffrey, 2008), it seems counterproductive to invest in such excessive mitigation strategies. What can instead be highlighted are improvements to countermeasures designed for smaller magnitude earthquakes that happen more commonly in Japan.</p>
